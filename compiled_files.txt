due to the security restrictions imposed in the mission statement,
all compiled code should be static.
external code (e.g. written in C/zig/C++/rust etc) should be static as well.

thusly, both the tegu bytecode of the proper executable and any
native code that is called from tegu must be bundled together.

all of the files required are bundled together into a .tar.gz, which is 
decompressed at runtime into a secure location on the filesystem
	(e.g. /tmp/xyz with a user or mod restriction),
and then all files are loaded into the tegu runtime and ran.

note, that as the external native code must be supplied in seperate files,
the external code must be provided as a dynamic object rather than a static object.
