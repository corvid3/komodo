== THE KOMODO COMPILER ==

internals of the komodo compiler are split up
into many different files, as to make working
on specific parts much easier to find and 
logically draw conclusions about.

==== CONCEPTS ====

following this section will be a multitude of subsections
describing concepts used within the komodo compiler.
we will work top-down in concepts.

==== TILE     ====
each runnable program compiled by the komodo compiler
is nicknamed a "tile", short for "reptile". 

a tile is made up of a tile.toml config file,
which contains information about how the file should be compiled
and a singular "main" scale which makes up the entire source tree besides
the external dependencies.

when compiled, a tile is converted into an tegu-executable .tar file,
which may be optionally compressed by an external algorithm.
this .tar file contains all of the necessary executable code to be ran by
the tegu virtual machine backend. more information on this can be found
in the tegu virtual machine design document.

==== SCALE    ====

composed of one or more files, zero or more other scales as dependencies,
and a config file, a scale is the base unit of source code within a komodo project.

an example of a scale is the standard library, which is itself a scale
composed up of many different scales, each performing a specific duty

scales themselves are not compiled into separate library files,
instead they are compiled directly into the resulting source executable.
in this way, all komodo executables are "static", as required by tegu. 

==== LEXER    ====

komodo works on a hand-written lexer, for speed
and customizability. all tokens in a file are
processed immediately upon creation of the
