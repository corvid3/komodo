SAFETY & SECURITY
	writing objectively wrong code in Komodo should be difficult,
	if not impossible. allowing those developing to do whatever they want,
	when they want, leads to code written that does not do what is
	specified in ways that may lead to security and safety concerns.
	constraints are provided within the language itself to prevent
	these logical deficits, aswell as other tools provided within the
	syntax that allow more restrictions if so desired.

	the Tegu engine which the Komodo runtime is based off of has (will have)
	abilities to limit those who should not have access to running 
	code by providing measures such as ssh keys, gpg keys, and much more.

STABILITY
	the Tegu engine which powers Komodo on should never crash due to an internal
	bug.
	
DEBUGGABILITY
	the Tegu engine allows (will allow) runtime debugging and hot code
	swapping via a serial connection potentially over the internet.
	mission critical code that may never be allowed to be shut down
	for more than a second should be able to be debugged in place, and
	replaced while running.
